## Technical Focus Areas
- **Causal & Experimentation:** A/B tests, uplift modeling, diff-in-diff and policy impact analysis.
- **Forecasting & Measurement:** ARIMA/Prophet/XGBoost time series, KPI design and variance drivers.
- **LLM & NLP:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), topic/sentiment, LLM evaluation and safety.  
- **Agents & Workflows:** Multi-agent pipelines (LangGraph, CrewAI, A2A protocol) for financial and healthcare tasks.  
- **LLM Fine-Tuning:** LoRA/QLoRA adaptation on biomedical and QA datasets; evaluation against baselines.  
- **Product Analytics:** funnels, cohorts, retention, user segmentation and experiment readouts.
